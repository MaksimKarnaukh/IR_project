## Project Description

This is a project for the Information Retrieval course at the University of Antwerp. 

It focuses on **Related Documents Retrieval**: Implement a retrieval system that retrieves related documents to a given document 
eg. news articles about the same event as a given news item, or academic papers on the same subject as a given paper. 

Implementation is in Python and the project is structured as follows:
