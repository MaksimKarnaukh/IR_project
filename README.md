# IR_project

## Project Description

This is a project for the Information Retrieval course at the University of Antwerp. 

It focuses on **Related Documents Retrieval**: Implement a retrieval system that retrieves related documents to a given document 
eg. news articles about the same event as a given news item, or academic papers on the same subject as a given paper. 

Implementation is in Python and the project is structured as follows:

Dataset sources:

The video game dataset and itâ€™s ground-truth labels.

https://github.com/microsoft/SDR/blob/main/data/datasets/video_games/gt (ground-truth labels)

## Installation

To install the project, clone the repository and install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the project, run the main.py file:

```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

This will run the GUI.

In the GUI, you can choose between title or query. 
If you decide to find similar games by title, 
you will have to select the title from the dropdown. 
If you decide to choose query, you can type the text of 
your choice such as keywords, and it will find games related to this text. 
The GUI also allows you to set the number of results to a certain value, 
for when you want to return more or less results. This is a top-K system 
where the K most similar games are returned. There are two output windows. 
The first one shows the top-K relevant documents (in this case games) and 
the second one shows the metrics, relevant to this search. 
Metrics are generated by using the ground-truth labels. 
Because of this, metrics can only be shown if you find relevant documents by title.
